## 🎭 The Board Members

| Member | Personality | Role |
|---|---|---|
| 🗣 **The Visionary** | Hyperactive, breathless, turbo-charged | Scales every idea into a global empire |
| 🛠 **The Pragmatist** | Slow, pedantic, methodical engineer | Grounds everything in cold, hard reality |
| ⚖️ **The Devil's Advocate** | Brash, blunt, zero diplomatic softening | Hunts for the one flaw that kills the whole plan |
| 📋 **The Chairperson** | Tired, exasperated, ultimately effective | Delivers the final actionable Board Resolution |

## ✨ Key Features

- **Default Model (No Key Required)** — Try the board without an API key, limited to 5 total turns on a default model.
- **PDF Upload & Analysis** — Attach any text-based PDF document for the board to analyse alongside your question.

## 🚀 Quick Start

You may of course just use the Live Link from the "About" section to directly access the Web App. Assuming you would like to run it locally, here's how:

### 1. Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- A Google AI Studio API key — [aistudio.google.com](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey) (or any supported provider key)

### 2. Clone & install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/romir1710/personal-board-of-directors-web.git
cd personal-board-of-directors-web

python -m venv .venv
# Windows
.venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS / Linux
source .venv/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Configure your `.env`

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Open `.env` and set:

```env
GOOGLE_API_KEY=AIza...your-key-here
```

### 4. Run the server

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000
```

### 5. Open the app

Navigate to **[http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)** in your browser.

## 🔑 API Key Support

The board supports multiple AI providers. You can enter your own API key from the sidebar after signing in:

| Provider | Model Used |
|---|---|
| **Google Gemini** | Gemini 2.5 Flash |
| **OpenAI** | GPT-4o |
| **Anthropic (Claude)** | Claude Sonnet |
| **OpenRouter** | Any model via OpenRouter relay |

> **Note:** If no API key is provided, the board runs on a default model with a limit of 5 total turns. Responses may not always be accurate and may occasionally return errors.

## 🔌 API Reference

### `POST /api/debate`

Accepts `multipart/form-data` with either:
- `text` — a plain string idea/question
- `file` — a PDF file (takes precedence if both provided)

Optional headers for custom API keys:
- `X-Api-Provider` — one of `gemini`, `openai`, `claude`, `openrouter`
- `X-Api-Key` — your API key for the chosen provider

Returns JSON:

```json
{
  "visionary":  "...",
  "pragmatist": "...",
  "advocate":   "...",
  "resolution": "..."
}
```

### `GET /health`

```json
{ "status": "ok", "service": "Personal Board of Directors" }
```

Interactive docs available at **[http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs)**.

## 📄 PDF Support

Upload any text-based PDF via the attach button. The server will:
1. Write the file to a temporary location
2. Extract all text using `pypdf`
3. Pass the extracted text through the Board of Directors graph
4. Delete the temp file immediately after processing

> **Note:** Scanned or image-only PDFs cannot be parsed — use text-based PDFs.
